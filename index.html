            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The h1-h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>the ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
            <li>For hyperlink, the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. To do this, we will use the HTML link element.  a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet; When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
            <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>

            <li>git pull origin main: pulling down the latest main branch</li>
            <li>git add -A: adding the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git, use add -A command to commit all files in the working branch</li>
            <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file/etc":this commits the staged directory to our repository, we use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code;  to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>The topics variable contains a string that includes all of the topics, the string is contained within quotation marks, All strings are surrounded by quotation marks. Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
            <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
            <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
            <li>Adding an array of topics and a for loop that can iterate over the array and log each topic in the console with only a few lines of code. </li>
            <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
