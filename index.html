        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. To do this, we will use the HTML link element.  a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet; When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
            <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
